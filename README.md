#### Intro

Hi! Thanks for checking out my project! This is my final project for Austin Coding Academy's Full Stack Developer bootcamp. I've taken all my knowledge from the past year and put it into this application.

The application is built using the MERN stack, and several React dependencies. Feel free to clone the repo and use it as a template for your own basic social network application.

Among all the resources I used to build 'innerwebnets', there are a few that I would like to comment on first:

#### Austin Coding Academy: I joined ACA in August 2018 with very little knowledge of web development. Over the past year I learned the fundamentals HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - as well as MERN stack technologies MongoDB (Atlas), Express.js, REACT, Node.js. Other technologies I used during the course include git, github, npm, Redux, thunk, mongoose, nodemon, React Router, Axios, concurrently, JSON web token, and OAuth.

#### Traversy University: I took several of Brad Traversy's courses in addition to my training at ACA to learn more about React, Redux and building full stack web applications in general. This project was based on his "MERN Stack Front to Back" course where he builds a full stack social network application. I would not have been able to complete this course if it were not for my training at ACA which is why it comes second.
